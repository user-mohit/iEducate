            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education
                system, which fall under the command of the government at three levels: central, state and local. Under
                various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education
                Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14.
                The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5.Up until 1976, education
                policies and implementation were determined legally by each of India's constitutional states. The 42nd
                amendment to the constitution in 1976 made education a 'concurrent subject'.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Poorly resourced public schools which suffer from high rates of teacher
                absenteeism may have encouraged the rapid growth of private (unaided) schooling in India, particularly
                in urban areas. Private schools divide into two types: recognized and unrecognized schools. Government
                'recognition' is an official stamp of approval and for this, a private school is required to fulfill a
                number of conditions, though hardly any private schools that get 'recognition' actually fulfill all the
                conditions of recognition. Indian schools are no less than factories. The emergence of large numbers of
                unrecognized primary schools suggests that schools and parents do not take government recognition as a
                stamp of quality. </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Although there are private schools in India, they are highly regulated
                in terms of what they can teach, in what form they can operate (must be a non-profit to run any
                accredited educational institution) and all the other aspects of the operation. Hence, the
                differentiation between government schools and private schools can be misleading.[22] However, in a
                report by Geeta Gandhi Kingdon entitled: The emptying of public Schools and growth of private schools in
                India, it is said that For sensible education policy making, it is vital to take account of the changing
                trends in the size of the private and public schooling sectors in India. Ignoring these trends involves
                the risk of poor policies/legislation, with attendant adverse consequences for children's life chances.
